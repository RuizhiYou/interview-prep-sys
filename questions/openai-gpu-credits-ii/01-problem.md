# Problem and Requirements

## Original prompt

> Detailed, non-verbatim reconstruction of candidate-reported prompts.
> Hack2Hire remains the source of record; exact wording, examples, and bounds
> should be confirmed with the interviewer before implementation.

## Reported problem family and variants

[Open question](https://www.hack2hire.com/question-bank/companies/openai/coding-questions/6913b4290ac116974ccedd12/practice?questionId=6913b4310ac116974ccedd13)

Manage uniquely identified GPU-credit grants, each valid over a time interval,
when grant and consumption events may arrive out of timestamp order. Support
point-in-time balance queries and consumption at a specified time, drawing from
eligible grants in earliest-expiration order.

Focus: event-time replay, overlapping validity intervals, priority queues,
earliest-expiry-first allocation, out-of-order insertion, deterministic ordering,
insufficient-credit behavior, and the cost of recomputation versus indexing.


## Clarifying questions

| Question | Answer | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which reported variant should be implemented first? | TBD with interviewer | Interview clarification |
| What are the exact input bounds and error semantics? | TBD with interviewer | Interview clarification |
| Is production-ready parsing/concurrency/persistence required? | Only when stated by the selected variant | Reported prompt summary |

## Functional requirements

- Implement the base problem described above.
- Treat each numbered variant as a reported follow-up, not as an implicit requirement of the base version.
- Preserve the stated API behavior, boundary semantics, and output format.

## Non-functional requirements

- Correctness: handle the listed edge cases and invariants.
- Complexity: state time and space complexity and meet any bound called out in the selected variant.
- Code quality: use testable components and make assumptions explicit.

## Out of scope

- Unreported product behavior or infrastructure requirements unless introduced by the interviewer.
- A final implementation or solution; those belong in `03-solution.md`.

## Scale assumptions

This is a coding-question family rather than a service-capacity exercise. Record
array sizes, graph sizes, timestamp ranges, or storage limits here once the
interviewer confirms them.

## Back-of-the-envelope estimates

Not applicable until concrete input bounds are selected for a variant.
